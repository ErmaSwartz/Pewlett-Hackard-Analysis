# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Purpose
#### The purpose of our analysis was to find all of the employees at the company who were getting ready to retire. The goal was to help the company find the relevant information that would allow them to prepare for the upcoming retirements and subsequent neccesarry hires. We also set out to find those who were already at the company who may be eligible for a mentorship so that those who already work at the company could take on the responsibilities of those begining to age out. 

### Results 
#### We found:
##### - There are 2131 people at the company that are eligible to be mentored. 
##### - There were 6 positions that people would be ritiring from 
##### - The position that will be needed most in the near future is staff
##### - Assistant Engineer will be the least in demand 
##### - The amount of people retiring is significantly greater than those eligible for mentorship 
##### - The company will need to hire a large amount of new employees

### Sumary 
##### 133,776 people will be retiring in the coming silver tsunami, the company will need to start looking for new people to bring in and train. There are more than enough people to mentor those who are eligible, but the company should start looking for those they can bring on as new hires to fill the positions of all those who will be aging out.
